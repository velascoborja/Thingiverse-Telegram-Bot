# Thingiverse Telegram Bot

Hi guys!

As I was experiencing lots of problems with **Thingiverse website** I developed a Telegram Bot in order to get access to all my `/likes`, `/collections`, `/designs` and `/makes` which were not working within Thingiverse website.

You can also check `/popular` stuff `/search` items or search by `/tag`

Everything you get a result for can be downloaded both in a zip or individual stl files, directly from Telegram

You can give it a try in here  [https://t.me/thingiversemakerbot](https://t.me/thingiversemakerbot)

Hope it's useful for someone!
